Common Definitions
------------------

----
DIR         := left | right | up | down
CYCLE_DIR   := next | prev
----

Selectors
---------

Selectors are used to select a target window, desktop, or monitor. A selector
can either describe the target relatively or name it globally.

Descriptive (relative) selectors consist of a primary selector and any number
of non-conflicting modifiers as follows:

	PRIMARY_SELECTOR[.MODIFIER]*

For obvious reasons, neither desktop nor monitor names may be valid descriptive
selectors.

An exclamation mark can be prepended to certain modifiers in order to reverse their meaning.
