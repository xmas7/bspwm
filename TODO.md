- Rewrite `find_neighbor` based on the distances between the windows sides (more intuitive).
- Rewrite `focus_follows_pointer` by using a root sized input only window mapped and unmapped via enter notify events.
- Use macros in `messages.c`.
- New setting: `windows_per_desktop` that would automatically send the oldest window of the current desktop to the first found desktop having a number of windows inferior to the limit and create a new desktop if there is none when the number of windows in the current desktop reaches the limit.
- Grow/shrink through swap.
- Command line completion for *bspc*.
- Better handling of the floating window concept.
- Focus history.
